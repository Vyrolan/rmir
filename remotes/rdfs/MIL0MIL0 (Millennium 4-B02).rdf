Name=Millennium 4 (B02)
Identification=Look around the JP-1 hole: B02 has no heat-stampings on the battery cover shelf(like B04); BUT, you can see Capacitor C-11 and component Y1 on the pcb looking into the JP-1 hole toward the bottom of the remote whereas on the B04 these components are not visible.  B02 *has* FixedData of "13" at $017 (don't manually change this value) believed to be for Eeprom size of 1K.jhg
