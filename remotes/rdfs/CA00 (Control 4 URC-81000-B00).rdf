# This remote shares the same signature with the Navigator URC-43000B01.
# Setup codes entered on the remote are 3 digits only. However, a 4 digit setup
# code may be assigned in IR.
# This remote cannot execute macros on any of the physical buttons on the remote.
# Setup functions:
# 975 - reset scrambled-keymap counter
# 980 - factory reset
# 981 - user reset
# 990 - setup code blink-back (3 digits only)
# 991 - setup code search
# 992 - change device button device type
# 993 - VPT device select (setting not stored in EEPROM)
# 994 - enter keymoves
# 995 - enter macros (but no buttons on this remote will accept macros)
# Buttons at the bottom of the remote may be be custom-labelled, or not labelled
# at all. This RDF refers to those buttons with a single letter, A through L.
#   A  B  C   Note: Button C is part of the transport keyset (TV/VCR function)
#   D  E  F
#   G  H  I
#   J  K  L
# This remote has transport-key punch-through. The transport buttons listed below
# will punch through from VCR or AUX device types. The transport buttons are:
# Play, Pause Stop, Rec, Rew, FF & C.
# Some buttons are defined as part of the keymaps that are not present on the
# remote. They are listed in this RDF file with {} around the button name, but
# cannot be used for any practical purpose without macro capability.
# The {P&P} device button is not present, and without macro support, cannot be
# accessed. The remote has 3 built-in setup codes for the P&P device type: 252, 465, 537.
# Byte $015 is the scrambled-keymap counter byte.
# Bytes $016-$01B are control bytes for multi-macros, not operational on this remote.
