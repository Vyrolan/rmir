# MultiMacros compliant with IR v6 or above.
# The second MultiMacro byte in this remote is not stored in the EEPROM.
# This RDF tells IR to use byte $3FF for the second byte as a workaround
# in order to get the correct value written to the first byte.
# Byte $3FF is outside the checksum range, and the remote will ignore its value.
# Remote has SETUP-993 for VPT device select, but its not stored in EEPROM.
