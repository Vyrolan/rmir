  <P>
  <H3><A name=1>1. What is JP1?</A></H3>JP1 is a home-made process that you can 
  use to re-program your UEI remote (ie, One For All and Radio Shack brands) 
  from your PC. Not only does it allow you to manage your macros, etc in a much 
  easier way than doing it on the remote itself, it also lets you overcode some 
  of the silly restrictions that are programmed into these remotes and it lets 
  you add upgrades which let the remote to control devices it would not 
  otherwise control. 
  <P>
  <H3><A name=2>2. Why Do I Need JP1?</A></H3>If you have a JP1 compatible 
  remote, but it doesn't control all of your devices, you need JP1 so you can 
  add upgrades which will let your remote control those devices. While some UEI 
  remotes are equiped with modems that allow you to download upgrades over the 
  phone (or web), this only works if UEI has already developed an upgrade for 
  your un-supported device. With JP1 you don't need to wait. In most cases, 
  someone else has already developed an upgrade that you can use, and even when 
  there's no upgrade available, you can easily create one yourself, as I will 
  describe in this document. 
  <P>
  <H3><A name=3>3. What Equipment Do I Need?</A></H3>Well, for starters, you 
  need a JP1 compatible remote, these are remotes made by UEI. The two main 
  brands that you will find in the stores are ‘One For All' and ‘Radio Shack', 
  but there are several other remotes out there that are also JP1 compatible. To 
  see if your remote is JP1 compatible, open up the battery compartment and see 
  if there's a 6-pin conenctor in there (like the one below). If you see 6 holes 
  rather than a 6-pin connector, you remote probably needs extra parts to be JP1 
  compatible. 
  <P>
  <CENTER><IMG 
  src="img/image001.jpg"><BR><B>Image 
  3.1 - the 6-pin connector.</B></CENTER>
  <P>Next, you need a JP1 cable. While these are easy to make yourself, for most 
  people it's simpler to just buy them ready made as prices start at just $14. 
  <P>You can buy JP1 cables from the following web sites: 
<br><a href="http://www.hifi-remote.com/cgi-bin/banners2.cgi?mode=redirect&ID=12">www.hovisdirect.com</a>
<br><a href="http://www.hifi-remote.com/cgi-bin/banners2.cgi?mode=redirect&ID=6">jp1.filebug.com</a>
<br><a href="http://www.hifi-remote.com/cgi-bin/banners2.cgi?mode=redirect&ID=25">www.diygadget.com</a>


  <P>You will need a Windows based computer, Macs and Linux based machines are 
  not supported at this time. 
  <P>Finally, you will need the JP1 software, which you can download for free 
  from the <A 
  href="http://www.hifi-remote.com/forums/dload.php?action=category&amp;cat_id=7">Tools 
  folder</A> of the <A href="http://www.hifi-remote.com/forums/dload.php">JP1 
  File Section</A>. It is also beneficial if you have MS Excel 97 or 2000 as 
  some of the JP1 tools are really Excel spreadsheets. 
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H3><A name=4>4. How Do You Use IR</A></H3>This is the program that you use to 
  communicate with your remote. You can use it to download your current 
  programming, you can save a copy of your current programming on your PC as a 
  backup, you can make changes to the programming, including adding upgrades, 
  etc and you can re-load it to your remote. 
  <P>First, download the program IR from the <A 
  href="http://www.hifi-remote.com/forums/dload.php?action=category&amp;cat_id=7">Tools</A> 
  folder. Unzip the contents of the file into a folder on your PC. Next download 
  the current set of RDFs, also from the <A 
  href="http://www.hifi-remote.com/forums/dload.php?action=category&amp;cat_id=7">Tools 
  folder</A> and unzip these into a separate folder. Finally, you will need to 
  establish a link between the RDFs and IR. To do this, fire up IR and select 
  <B>File &gt; Set RDF Path</B>, this will bring up a standard Windows pop-up 
  screen where you can select the folder you created for the RDFs. You will also 
  need to download the DecodeIR.dll program, which you can either store in the 
  same directory as IR.exe, or better yet, you should store in your Windows / 
  System directory as it is used by several other JP1 programs. 
  <P>I am going to show some screen shots of the IR program, if you want to walk 
  along with these, you can open the file ‘FromRob.txt' that's included in the 
  IR zip file. 
  <P>First things first, start up the IR program and, with your remote connected 
  to the JP1 cable, click on the ‘Download From Remote' button. You should see a 
  screen somewhat like that shown in Image 4.1. 
  <P>You'll notice that the IR program is deviced into several tabs. The actual 
  tabs displayed will vary by remote, for example, if your remote doesn't have 
  learning, the learning tab may not be displayed. 
  <P>I am now going to briefly describe some of the main tabs that you will use, 
  but I will skip a couple that I will cover later. 
  <P>
  <CENTER><IMG 
  src="img/image002.jpg"><BR><B>Image 
  4.1 - IR.exe's General Tab</B></CENTER>
  <P><B>General Tab.</B><BR>
  <P>With the General Tab selected, you can see what setup codes you have 
  assigned to each of the device buttons on your remote (eg, on this remote, the 
  TV/0156 code is assigned to the TV button). You can also see how any of the 
  other settings have been programmed (eg, on this remote, Volume Punch Thru is 
  turned on and is set to the TV device) </P>
  <P><B>Key Moves Tab.</B><BR>"Key Moves" are buttons programmed using the Key 
  Mover function, which can either mean the button was copied from another 
  button, or it was programmed using an advanced code. This tab shows you all 
  the keymoves programmed in this remote. You can also edit, add or delete 
  keymoves from this tab. 
  <P><B>Macros Tab.</B><BR>As the name implies, this tab shows you all the 
  macros you have programmed. 
  <P><B>Learned Signals tab.</B><BR>This tab shows you all the buttons that you 
  have programmed using the remote's learning function. In addition to showing 
  you which buttons hold learned signals, it also shows you what those learned 
  signals look like, but more on that later. 
  <P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H3><A name=5>5. How Do You Load An Upgrade</A></H3>
  <P>If you have an unsupported device, take a look in the <A 
  href="http://www.hifi-remote.com/forums/dload.php?action=category&amp;cat_id=4">Device 
  Upgrades</A> folder at <A 
  href="http://www.hifi-remote.com/forums">http://www.hifi-remote.com/forums</A> 
  and see if there's one ready-made that you can use. Remember, you don't 
  typically need to find an exact match on the model number of the device as 
  most major brand manufacturers use the same IR signals for all similar devices 
  (ie, for all TVs, etc).</P>
  <P>If you don't find a file there, check at the old JP1 group at Yahoo. There 
  are two places to check: <A 
  href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jp1/files/3.%20Device%20Codes/">Device 
  Codes</A> and <A 
  href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jp1/files/4.%20RM%20Upgrade%20Files/">RM 
  Upgrade Files</A>. </P>
  <P>If you find an upgrade, be aware that KM files (.txt) can usually be used 
  with either KM or RM, but RM files (.rmdu) can only be used with RM. 
  <P>If you find a file you can use, you need to open the file using either <A 
  href="http://www.hifi-remote.com/files/tools/keymap-master.zip">KM (Keymap 
  Master)</A> or <A 
  href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=30560">RM (Remote 
  Master)</A>, both of which can be downloaded from the <A 
  href="http://www.hifi-remote.com/forums/dload.php?action=category&amp;cat_id=7">Tools</A> 
  folder.</P>
  <P>Since there are two tools for handling device upgrades, we are often asked 
  which one is preferred. The answer is neither. They each have their own 
  advantages and disadvantages:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Keymap Master (KM) 
    <UL>
      <LI>It's the original. Some things that were implemented have not (yet) 
      been implemented in RM. 
      <LI>It requires Microsoft Excel '97 or later. It will not work with any 
      other spreadsheet application. Excel is expensive. 
      <LI>It can only load KM device upgrade files. 
      <LI>Has support for some more protocols than RM (the list is getting 
      smaller all the time). </LI></UL>
    <LI>RemoteMaster (RM) 
    <UL>
      <LI>It's the new kid on the block! The first prototype was made available 
      on 2/10/2003. 
      <LI>It does <B>NOT</B> require Microsoft Excel. It uses Java instead. Java 
      is a free download. 
      <LI>It has a (subjectively) better user interface. It provides a graphical 
      interface for assigning functions to buttons. 
      <LI>It can load <B>most</B> KM or all RM device upgrade files. It cannot 
      load KM files that use unsupported protocols. </LI></UL></LI></UL>
  <P>I will describe here how to use RM. Please read the <A 
  href="http://controlremote.sourceforge.net/Readme.html#start">Getting 
  Started</A> section of RM's <A 
  href="http://controlremote.sourceforge.net/Readme.html">Readme.html</A> file 
  for system requirements and installation instructions.</P>
  <P>The first time you use RM, a pop-up will appear declaring <B>No RDF files 
  were found!</B>. Now to worry, just press the OK button, and RM will display a 
  file dialog for you to specify where you've placed the RDFs. It defaults to 
  the <B>rdf</B> subdirectory in the directory you installed RM. Just navigate 
  to the folder in which you've placed the RDFs and press the <B>Open</B> 
  button. 
  <P>Let me warn you in advance, RM can look quite intimidating, this is because 
  you can use it to create brand new upgrades, but when all you need to do is 
  load a ready-made upgrade, which is what we're doing here, you can ignore 90% 
  of what you see in RM.</P>
  <P align=center><IMG 
  src="img/rm-start.jpg"><BR><B>Image 
  5.1 - RM's initial screen.</B></P>
  <P>Image 5.1 shows what RM looks like when it's first opened. Use the 
  <B>Open...</B> menu item on the <B>File</B> menu (circled in red in Image 5.2) 
  to open the upgrade file that you downloaded from the file section.</P>
  <P align=center><IMG 
  src="img/rm-open.jpg"><BR><B>Image 
  5.2 - Opening a file in RM</B></P>
  <P>This will bring up RM's open file dialog. In order to load a KM upgrade 
  file, you must change the <B>Files of type:</B> field to <B>KeyMapMaster 
  device upgrade files</B> as shown in Image 5.3. 
  <P align=center><IMG 
  src="img/rm-filedlg.jpg"><BR><B>Image 
  5.3 - RM's File dialog</B></P>
  <P>Loading the file will automatically populate all the required fields in RM. 
  For this example I am going to load one of the files for ReplayTV. Image 5.4 
  shows what RM looks like with an upgrade loaded.</P>
  <P align=center><IMG 
  src="img/rm-loaded.jpg"><BR><B>Image 
  5.4 - RM with an upgrade loaded.</B></P>
  <P>You'll be pleased to know that the only part of this screen that you need 
  to worry about at this point is the one circled in red.</P>
  <P>Use the "Remote" drop down menu to change the selected remote to the remote 
  you are trying to program. This is the only setting that you really need to 
  change. You can change the "Device Type" setting if you want, and you can 
  change the "Setup Code" number, but you don't need to. For now, you can ignore 
  everything else on this screen. 
  <P>The next screen in RM that is of interest to you is the "Functions" panel, 
  shown in Image 5.5. The entries listed here are all the functions that the 
  user who created this upgrade chose to include. Hopefully this is a complete 
  list, but that's not always the case. If you have additional codes that you 
  have obtained from elsewhere, you can add them here. Make sure that when you 
  enter the additional codes you put them in the corrent column, either "OBC" 
  (which stands for "Original Button Code") or "EFC" (which stands for "Extended 
  Function Code", which are also known as "advanced codes")</P>
  <P align=center><IMG 
  src="img/rm-functions.jpg"><BR><B>Image 
  5.5 - RM's Functions Panel</B></P>
  <P>The next screen of interest is the "Buttons" panel, as shown in Image 5.6. 
  On this panel, you can check that the functions are assigned to the buttons of 
  your choice. Remember, just because it made sense for the buttons to be 
  assigned the way they are for the original selected remote, doesn't mean it 
  will make sense for your remote. You can assign functions to buttons in 4 
  different ways: 
  <OL>
    <LI>Press the <B>Auto assign</B> button to get some functions automatically 
    assigned. The ones that get assigned automatically are the ones where you 
    used the default function names and there's an equivilent button on your JP1 
    remote for that function. You are under no obligation to accept these 
    default assignments. 
    <LI>Drag-n-drop a function onto the desired button 
    <LI>Right-click on a button and select the desired function 
    <LI>Click on a button (It will he outlined in white), then double-click the 
    desired function. </LI></OL>Use the <B>- none -</B> function to clear the 
  function assigned to a button.
  <P></P>. 
  <P><B>Note:</B> if a button is greyed out, it either doesn't exist on your 
  remote, or it's not possible to program it.</P>
  <P align=center><IMG 
  src="img/rm-buttons.jpg"><BR><B>Image 
  5.6 - RM's Button Panel</B></P>
  <P>RM provides another way to check the assignment of functions to buttons, 
  the Layout Panel, shown in Image 5.7. On this panel, buttons with assigned 
  functions are colored in yellow, and buttons that are present in the key map 
  for the selected device type are outlined in orange. Also, functions can be 
  assigned to buttons in 4 different ways: 
  <OL>
    <LI>Press the <B>Auto assign</B> button to get some functions automatically 
    assigned. The ones that get assigned automatically are the ones where you 
    used the default function names and there's an equivilent button on your JP1 
    remote for that function. You are under no obligation to accept these 
    default assignments. 
    <LI>Drag-n-drop a function onto the desired button 
    <LI>Right-click on a button and select the desired function 
    <LI>Click on a button, then double-click the desired function. </LI></OL>
  <P></P>
  <P align=center><IMG 
  src="img/rm-layout.jpg"><BR><B>Image 
  5.7 - RM's Layout Panel</B></P>
  <P>Once you have entered any additional functions that you have codes for, and 
  have assigned the functions to the buttons of your choice, you are ready to 
  load your upgrade. To do this, go back to the Output panel, shown in Image 
  5.8. The block of code circled in green is your device upgrade, click on 
  <B>Copy</B> above and to the right to ‘copy' the code to the clipboard.</P>
  <P><B>Note:</B> You can also ‘copy' the code by right-clicking on it, and 
  selecting ‘Copy' from the pop-up menu.</B> 
  <P align=center><IMG 
  src="img/rm-output.jpg"><BR><B>Image 
  5.8 - RM's Output Panel</B></P>
  <P>Back in IR.exe you will need to select the "Devices" tab, as shown in Image 
  5.9. This is one of the tabs that we skipped over earlier. Press the ‘Add' 
  button and paste the code that you copied into the pop-up window. 
  <P align=center><IMG 
  src="img/image007.jpg"><BR><B>Image 
  5.9 - IR's Devices Tab - Add pop-up Screen.</B></P>
  <P>The paste function will automatically populate the Device Type and Setup 
  Code boxes, even though IR will let you change these settings, it's not a good 
  idea to do so. If there are keymoves associated with this upgrade, those will 
  get populated into the Key Moves / Macros box.</P>
  <P>If RM displays a protocol upgrade (in the area marked with a blue circle in 
  Image 5.8) you will also need to copy this over to IR. You can use the 
  <B>Copy</B> above and to the right or you use the copy function in the pop-up 
  context menu. Then in IR you will need to go to the Protocols tab, as shown in 
  Image 5.10. Click the ‘Add' button and then paste the protocol code into the 
  pop-up window. The Protocol Id field will be populated automatically. 
  <P>Don't forget to assign the new setup code that you created to an actual 
  device button!</P>

  <H3><A name=6>6. How Do You Create An Upgrade From Scratch?</A></H3>
  <P>If you have an unsupported device, and you you can't find an upgrade file 
  for it in the file section, your next step is to create one yourself. If you 
  have a JP1 remote with learning, this is easy to do. If you don't have a 
  learning remote, all is not lost. I'll discuss what you can do in that 
  situation a little later.</P>
  <P>To create an upgrade yourself, here's what you do. First, download your 
  remote's current memory and save it. You can always use this file to restore 
  the remote to it's current condition later, if needed. Next, delete any 
  learned signals that are already in the remote. The easiest way to do this is 
  to go to the "Learned Signals" tab in IR and click the "Delete All" button, 
  then reload. To do it using the remote itself, for non LCD remotes, you can 
  use the 980 command, and for LCD remotes, you can select "OPS RESET" from the 
  LCD menu screens.</P>
  <P>Next up, you'll need to learn as many buttons from your original remote as 
  you can. Most JP1 learning remotes can only learn about 24 buttons before the 
  memory is full, so it's probably going to take a couple of passes to capture 
  all the buttons from the original remote. I recommend that you start off 
  learning all the buttons that have equivilent buttons on the JP1 learning 
  remote (eg, the numeric buttons, volume and channel buttons, etc). When you 
  reach the memory limit, download the memory and save the file. Then delete all 
  the learned signals like you did before and continue learning. As soon as you 
  reach the memory limit again, or you run out of buttons to learn, download and 
  save the file. When you start learning the more unusual buttons from your 
  original remote (eg, ANGLE, ZOOM, etc) be sure to make a note of which button 
  you learned them to on your JP1 remote. 
  <P>Once all the buttons are learned, you can start the process of decoding 
  them. To do this, go to the "Learned Signals" tab in IR. You will see all your 
  learned buttons listed in the column on the left. When you click on one of 
  these entries, the infra red info will be displayed on the right, as shown in 
  Image 6.1. 
  <P>
  <CENTER><IMG 
  src="img/image009.jpg"><BR><B>Image 
  6.1 - IR's Learned Signals Tab</B></CENTER>
  <P>In image 6.1 you can see that the RECORD button in AUX1 mode has been 
  selected. In this case, IR was successfully able to decode the signal and has 
  displayed the IR info. This signal uses the NECx2 protocol, with a device code 
  of 5 and a sub-device code also of 5. Chances are, all of the buttons for this 
  device with use the same protocol and device codes, what will change for each 
  button are the OBC and EFC codes. Just FYI, this is the ‘record' button for a 
  Samsung VCR, which responds to the VCR/0240 setup code. 
  <P>To start creating an upgrade for this device, you should fire up 
  RemoteMaster. Then in the Setup tab, you should make the entries described in 
  the following table. Image 6.2 shows RM's Setup panel after all the correct 
  entries have been made.

  6.2 - The beginnings of an upgrade</B></CENTER>
  <P>So far so good, now you need to go to the Functions panel and enter the 
  data for all the buttons that you learned. It's a good idea to understand RM's 
  terminology at this point. The word "Functions" refers to the buttons that you 
  learned from your original remote, you can use the exact names as printed on 
  your original remote, or you can expand it a little to make it easier to 
  understand. For example, you might have a button labelled "CHP/TME" but it 
  might be a good idea to enter it as "Chapter/Time". Alternatively, you could 
  enter it as "CHP/TME" then make an entry in the Notes column to describe what 
  it does. When RM refers to "Buttons", it's referring to the buttons on your 
  JP1 remote, not your original remote.</P>
  <P>When you first go to the Functions tab, you will see a lot of function 
  names already entered, as shown in image 6.3. These entries are just defaults 
  designed to save you some typing, you are under no obligation to use them. You 
  can delete them all if you like.</P>
  <P>Using the example of the RECORD button for my Samsung VCR, I can now enter 
  the OBC code of 20 next to the default entry for the RECORD button. Once 
  you've entered all the standard buttons for your device, you can delete all 
  the remaining entries. For the more unusual buttons, you will need to create 
  new entries for them. Please enter the data for all the buttons on your 
  original remote, even if you have no intention of programming them to physical 
  buttons.</P>
  <P align=center><IMG 
  src="img/rm-newfunctions.jpg"><BR><B>Image 
  6.3 - RM's Functions Panel - default screen</B></P>
  <P>Once you have entered all the info for your learned buttons, your next step 
  is to assign those functions to the buttons on your remote. You can do this on 
  the Layout or Buttons panels.</P>
  <P>You can assign functions to buttons visually using the Layout panel, shown 
  in Image 6.4. 
  <P>You'll notice that the list of functions that you entered in the Functions 
  sheet is displayed on the right. Once a function has been assigned to a 
  button, the name of that function is written in black. Functions that haven't 
  been assigned are written in red. You'll notice that the <B>input toggle</B> 
  function has not been assigned and I am using the context menu to assign it to 
  the <B>Program/Guide</B> button. Buttons with assigned functions are colored 
  in yellow, and buttons that are present in the key map for the selected device 
  type are outlined in orange. You can assign functions to buttons in 4 
  different ways: 
  <OL>
    <LI>Press the <B>Auto assign</B> button to get some functions automatically 
    assigned. The ones that get assigned automatically are the ones where you 
    used the default function names and there's an equivilent button on your JP1 
    remote for that function. You are under no obligation to accept these 
    default assignments. 
    <LI>Drag-n-drop a function onto the desired button 
    <LI>Right-click on a button and select the desired function 
    <LI>Click on a button (It will he outlined in white), then double-click the 
    desired function. </LI></OL>Use the <B>- none -</B> function to clear the 
  function assigned to a button.

  <P>If you find that many of the buttons that you want to program are not 
  outlined in orange, meaning they aren't included in the key map for the 
  selected Device Type, it might be a good idea to try using a different Device 
  Type. Maybe there's a device mode available that has more buttons included 
  that you can use. You won't always want to pick the mode with the most 
  buttons, just pick the mode that has the most buttons that you wish to program 
  included. There are a couple of things to consider before you chose a 
  different device type though. First off, if you use a device type that is 
  different to the default device type for the device button that you're 
  intending to program, it will break VPT (Volume Punch Through). This may or 
  may not be of concern to you. Secondly, if you are programming a remote with 
  an LCD screen (like the 15-2116, URC-8910, etc), the mode you pick is what 
  will be displayed on the screen when you select this device. So for example, 
  if you are creating an upgrade for a VCR and you use CBL as your device type, 
  "CBL" or "CBL2" is what will appear on the screen when you press the VCR 
  device button. Again, this may or may not be an issue for you.</P>
  <P>The Buttons panel is shown in Image 6.5. You can assign functions to 
  buttons in 4 different ways: 
  <OL>
    <LI>Press the <B>Auto assign</B> button to get some functions automatically 
    assigned. The ones that get assigned automatically are the ones where you 
    used the default function names and there's an equivilent button on your JP1 
    remote for that function. You are under no obligation to accept these 
    default assignments. 
    <LI>Drag-n-drop a function onto the desired button 
    <LI>Right-click on a button and select the desired function 
    <LI>Click on a button (it will be highlighted), then double-click the 
    desired function. </LI></OL>Use the <B>- none -</B> function to clear the 
  function assigned to a button.
  <P></P>
  <P>You'll notice that the list of functions that you entered in the Functions 
  sheet is displayed on the right. Once a function has been assigned to a 
  button, the name of that function is written in black. Functions that haven't 
  been assigned are written in red. In image 6.5 you'll notice that the <B>input 
  toggle</B> function has not been assigned and I am using the context menu to 
  assign it to the <B>Program/Guide</B> button. 
  <P>If a button name is followed by an asterisk ("*"), it means that it cannot 
  be included in the upgrade and will be programmed using a keymove instead. All 
  functions assigned to shifted buttons will be programmed using keymoves.

  <P>Once you've finished entering all the functions and assigning them to 
  buttons, you should save your device upgrade using the <B>Save As...</B> item 
  on the <B>File</B> menu. In order to be a good citizen, you should then load 
  this file into the appropiate folder in the Yahoo group for others to share. 
  <P>Finally, you should copy this upgrade over to IR following the same 
  procedures outlined in section 5 of this document. Don't forget to assign the 
  new setup code that you created to an actual device button! 
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H3>If you don't have a learning remote</H3>There are sometimes other ways to 
  get the required data. If you have found a setup code that works some of the 
  functions, post a message in the forums mentioning what that setup code is and 
  one of us will give you the data you need. 
  <P>Another good source for this data in the Pronto file section at Remote 
  Central. If you can find a file there for your device (remember, you don't 
  necessary need to find an exact match for the model number of your device), 
  you can download the file and run the DecodeCCF program (available in the 
  Yahoo file section) against it. This program will create a text file, that you 
  can open with a spreadsheet program such as Excel, that lists the protocol and 
  other codes for all the learned signals contained within the CCF file. 
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <H3>In Closing</H3>I hope this document has helped show you how easy using JP1 
  can really be. I was inspired to write is because of the numerous posts I have 
  seen in the forums where people say "I know I can do it with JP1, but that 
  looks too difficult for me".
