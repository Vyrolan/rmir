<h1><a name="general"></a>General Notes</h1>
<p>Remote Master (aka RM) was originally designed and developed primarily by Greg Bush, with significant contributions from John S Fine, Nils Ekberg, and others.</p>
<p>RM is a Java application.  That means that in order to run RM, you must have either the Java Developer Kit or
the Java Runtime Environemt installed, version 1.4.1 or later.  Either of these can be downloaded from the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads/index.html">J2SE Downloads</a> page.</p> 
<p>The Remote Master user interface makes extensive use of context menus. On most platforms, context menus are accessed by clicking the right mouse button in an area when you want to do something.  RemoteMaster also often provides multiple ways to accomplish the same task.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the Layout panel, which shows an image of the remote being used on the left, and a list of the available functions on the right.  There are 3 different ways to assign a function to a button: 
<ol>
<li>Drag and drop the desired function onto the desired button.
<li>Right-click on a button and select the desired function from the context menu
<li>Highlight a button by clicking on it.  Then double-click on the function you want assigned to it.
</ol>
<h1><a name="start"></a>Getting Started</h1>
<ol>
<li>If you haven't already, download and install Java, version 1.4.1 or later.  You can download it from the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads/index.html">J2SE Download</a> page.  Either the Java Developer Kit (JDK) or the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) will do.</li>
<li>Download the latest version of Remote Master from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=30560&package_id=22596">SourceForge</a>, and unzip it to the directory of your choice, preserving directory names.</li>
<li>If you are using a version of Windows (95/98/NT/XP), double-click on the <b><tt>Setup.bat</tt></b> and then click <b>Yes</b>.</li>
<li>If you haven't already, download the lastest version of the Remote Definition Files (RDFs) from the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jp1/files/2.%20Tools/">JP1 Yahoo Group</a>.</li>
<li>Unzip it to the directory of your choice.  It is recommended that you do <b>NOT</b> place it in the same directory as you placed Remote Master.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it, Remote Master is now ready for your use!  There are a few different ways to start Remote Master:
<ol>
<li>Double-click on <b><tt>RemoteMaster.jar</tt></b>.</li>
<li>Double-click on <b><tt>rmaster.bat</tt></b>.</li>
<li>Double-click on a Remote Master Device Upgrade file (*.rmdu).</li>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click on a link to a Remote Master Device Upgade file (*.rmdu).</li>
</ol>
<h1><a name="main"></a>Using Remote Master</h1>
<p>Remote Master was loosely based on Keymap Master, so there are many similarities between the two.  Anyone familiar with Keymap Master will have no trouble using Remote Master.</p>
<p>However, because Remote Master is a true application, while Keymap Master is a spreadsheet that behaves like an application, the Remote Master user interface does have some significant differences from Keymap Master.</p>
<h2><a name="menubar"></a>The Menu Bar</h2>
<p>The Remote Master menu bar provides access to general functions and options.
<h3><a name="filemenu"></a>The File Menu</h3>
<p>The File menu provides ways to load and save Device Upgrade files.  Below are the menu items available, and what they do:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>New</th>
<td>Set all upgrade information to default values, as though starting from scratch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Open...</th>
<td>Bring up a file dialog allowing you to load an existing Remote Master Device Upgrade (rmdu) file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Save</th>
<td>This menu will save the device upgrade to a file.  This item will be diabled unless a device upgrade file was loaded, or the "Save as..." item has been used.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Save&nbsp;as...</th>
<td>Save the device upgrade to a different file name.  The default file name will be the name of the file loaded, or the name used for "Save as...", or the contents of the <b>Desription</b> field.
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Import&nbsp;KM&nbsp;file...</th>
<td>Brings up a file dialog allowing you to load an existing KM device upgrade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Import&nbsp;from&nbsp;Clipboard</th>
<td>Imports a device upgrade from the clipboard.  This is useful if you click on a link to a device upgrade (either KM or RM), and your browser simply displays the text of the upgrade.  Simply use the context-menu (right-click) to <b>Select All</b> and then <b>Copy</b> the entire upgrade to the clipboard.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Recent</th>
<td>Lists up to the 10 most recently opened, or saved, RM device upgrade files.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Exit</th>
<td>Exit Remote Master</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3><a name="options"></a>The Options Menu</h3>
<p>The Options menu provides ways to customize Remote Master</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Look&nbsp;and&nbsp;Feel</th>
<td>Allows you to select the over all look and feel used by RemoteMaster.  Most of the time this should be left to the default value, but you might want to experiment to see how RemoteMaster would look on other platforms.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Prompt&nbsp;to&nbsp;Save</th>
<td>Allows you to specify when Remote Master will prompt you to save your Device Upgrade.  The valid values are:
<table>
<tr>
<th><u>A</u>lways</th>
<td>Whenever an action you perform might cause you to lose the contents of the Device Ugrade.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>On&nbsp;E<u>x</u>it</th>
<td>Whenever you exit Remote Master</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th><u>N</u>ever</th>
<td>You will never tbe prompted to save a Device Upgrade, you will remember to do it yourself.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Remotes</th>
<td><p>Allows you to choose the set of remotes that RemoteMaster will display. Your choices are <b>All</b>, meaning all remotes for which RemoteMaster can find Remote Definition Files (RDFs), or <b>Preferred</b>, meaning only those remotes that are in your preferred list.</p>
<p>You can manage the list of preferred remotes using <b>Edit Preferred</b>.</p>
</tr>
</table>
<h2><a name="basic"></a>Basic Information</h2>
<p>Some of basic information about the current Device Upgrade is always visible:<p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Description</th>
<td>Enter a brief descriptive name for your upgrade. Something as simple as "My Cable Box" will work, but since we encourage sharing upgrades with the group, a more descriptive entry like "General Instruments Digital Cable CBL/0476" is best.  The Description will be used as the default proposed filename when the Device Upgrade is saved using <b>Save As...</b>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Remote</th>
<td>Use the drop-down list to select the desired remote you want to build an upgrade for. A Device Upgrade for one model
remote will NOT work on another. Selecting the proper remote here is important.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Device&nbsp;Type</th>
<td>Use the drop-down list to select the desired type of device. Note that an upgrade can utilize ANY device regardless of
what device button it will be assigned to on the remote. Also, different device types use different key maps. If you'd like to see what buttons are available in a given device mode for the selected remote, view the Layout panel, which shows a picture of the remote with the buttons that are in the key map outlined in white.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2><a name="setup"></a>The Setup Panel</h2>
<p>Use the Setup panel to enter key information about the device upgrade:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Setup Code</th>
<td>Enter a 4-digit number between 0000 and 2047. If creating an upgrade of an existing code, the JP1 convention is to add 1000 to the existing number. For example, if you're creating an upgrade for Cable/0476, you might use 1476 as the Setup Code. It's acceptable to use the same number as a built-in code, however, this precludes using the built-in code on the remote itself, since upgrades in EEPROM are used before those built-in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Upgrade&nbsp;Notes</th>
<td>You can use this area to more accurately describe what your upgrade is, what it does, how it does it, etc. Again, this is useful as we share these files with others. Want to leave it blank? Go ahead, that's ok, too.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Protocol</th>
<td>Use the drop-down list to select the desired protocol to be used by the upgrade. If a protocol has been recognized, it's probably available in Remote Master (the vast majority of devices use only a handful of protocols).
<!--
There are two "special" protocols included in KM:

"Manual Settings" is used when KM doesn't directly support the
protocol you're working with.

"Device Combiner" allows you to combine multiple devices (up to
16) into one Device Upgrade.

For details on using either of these protocols, see the "keymap-
master-protocols.txt" file.
-->
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Protocol ID</th>
<td>Shows the Protocol ID (PID) of the protocol selected above.  This value cannot be changed directly.
<tr>
<th>Protocol&nbsp;Parameters</th>
<td>Protocols generally require some device level parameters
(some don't require any). These are the codes sent at the start of every IR (infrared) data stream, sort of like a "header".  RM will provide hints as to what needs to be entered for a given protocol.  These hints will appear as fly-over help when the mouse pointer is held over the input area for a short period of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Protocol&nbsp;Notes</th>
<td>Provides a brief description and help notes for certain selected protocols.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>At this point, you're ready to proceed to the Functions panel.</p>
<h2><a name="functions"></a>The Functions Panel</h2>
<p>Use this panel to define all the functions available for the device you are going to control.  This is where you can enter the EFCs, OBCs, and other parameters specific to each command.  Note that some of the command parameters are protocol specific, so not all of the columns available in each protocol will be documented here, only the ones that are used by all protocols.</p>
<p>The command parameter columns are often interdependent, so that entering a value in one column will often cause changes in other columns.
<p>You can sort the table by any of the columns by clicking on the column header. This is useful for seeing if there are any missing EFCs or OBCs that you might want to try if you are searching for discrete codes.  Click on the "#" column to restore the table to its natural order.</p>
<p>You can reorder the columns by simply dragging a column header to the desired location. Note, however that this reordering will not be preserved if you switch to another panel.</p>
<p>You can do some limited resizing of the columns by dragging the dividers between column headers. Note, however, that the resizing will not be preserved if you swtich to another panel.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>#</th>
<td>This is the function number, which is the order the functions have been defined.  You cannot edit this value, however, you can drag the number up or down to change the functions's position in the list.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Functions</th>
<td>This column contains some pre-defined function names. These can be used as is, or you can rename them to something more appropriate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>EFC</th>
<td>Enter the EFC (usually a 3-digit number from 000-255) for the corresponding function.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>OBC</th>

<td>Enter the raw hex for the command, as groups of 2 hex digits separated by spaces. For examaple "0C A9".  You usually won't edit this field, you will let RM compute the value based on information entered in the other columns.
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Description</th>
<td>Here, you can enter a brief description of the corresponding function for more clarity (and to help others who may use the file</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In addition to entering data in the various cells of the table, you can manipulate the table using the buttons at the bottom, or by using the context menu.</p>
<table>

<th>New</th>
<td>Add a new empty function.  If no function is currently selected, the new function will be added at the bottom.  If a function is selected, the new function will be inserted above the selected function.  This can also be accomplished
by using the context menu.  Just right click where you want to add the new function, and select <b>New</b>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Delete</th>
<td>Delete the currently selected function(s).  Functions that have been assigned to buttons cannot be deleted.  You can select multile functions. This can also be accomplished using the context menu.  Simply right-click on the function you want to delete and select <b>Delete</b>.  If the function you right-clicked on is one of many selected functions, all the functions will be deleted.</td>

</table>

<h2><a name="extfunctions"></a>External Functions</h2>
<pre>
NOTE: This feature requires IR v3.12 or later. Key Moves will not
be bound properly with earlier versions.

You may define functions that are actually commands from another
Setup Code. For example, if you're creating an upgrade for
TV/1000 and need a function or two from VCR/2000, you can specify
the function parameters on the [Functions] sheet. To do so, the
following syntax MUST be used when entering the function:

1) In the Function column, enter a function label that uses this
format:

=<devtype>/<4-digit_setupcode> <description>

"=" is REQUIRED for KM to recognize this as an "external
function".

<devtype> (REQUIRED) is the name of the device type EXACTLY as it
appears on the [Functions] sheet in the "Available Device  Types"
section (this list contains the same entries as the   Device Type
drop-down on the [Setup] sheet).

"/" is REQUIRED.

<4-digit_setupcode> (REQUIRED) is the 4-digit decimal Setup Code
(MUST be 4 digits).

<description> (OPTIONAL) is a name or description of the function
(used only to differentiate the name in the Function list).
Everything AFTER the 4-digit Setup Code is part of the
<description> field.

For example, to use a function (i.e. "TV/VCR") from VCR/2000, you
might enter:

  =VCR/2000 TV/VCR

Again, the <description> is optional, but recommended for clarity
(especially if you want to create more than 1 external function
from the same Setup Code), i.e.:

  =VCR/2000 TV/VCR
  =VCR/2000 Input Select

2) In the EFC/OBC column (B), use KM's direct hex code entry
feature to enter the functions hex command.

NOTE: A single-byte hex command MUST be prefixed or suffixed with
"h" (i.e. "h34" or "34h"). Multiple-byte hex commands MUST be
entered with a space between each byte ("00 34", "FF 00", or "AA
BB CC DD" are all valid entries).

Valid "external functions" entered on the Functions sheet might
look like this:

Functions                EFC
----------------------- -----
=vcr/2000 tv/vcr         hFF
=vcr/2000 input select   h00

3) On the [Buttons] and/or [Key Moves] sheets, assign the
function in the normal fashion; KM will create the appropriate
Key Move code automatically. IR (v3.12 or later) will bind the
Key Moves to the appropriate device when the code is pasted.


Using the [Buttons] worksheet:
==============================
The last step (in theory anyway) to building a Device Upgrade is
to assign the defined Functions to specific Buttons. You do this
on the [Buttons] worksheet. The Button column contains several
"generic" and many "remote-specific" button names. Only those
buttons that are not grayed-out are available for mapping.

NOTE: You CANNOT assign and use functions in an upgrade on any
buttons other than those defined by the default "key map"
designated by the remote (this is a limitation of the remotes
themselves and not a "flaw" in KM), or those buttons that are
able to be "key moved". This includes device buttons, "special"
buttons, etc. If it's not on the list or is grayed-out, YOU
CANNOT USE THAT BUTTON!

You can also define Key Moves bound to the current Device Upgrade
for buttons that are not part of the default key map right along
with the defined key map buttons. IR v3.10 or later will
automatically assign these Key Moves to the same device button
that the Device Upgrade gets assigned to.

If a button name is preceded with "@" (i.e. "@ setup"), or any
time a Shifted Function is assigned to ANY button, KM will
automatically create Key Move code. Only physically available or
defined buttons are available with this feature. If you want to
assign Key Moves to other buttons, or bind them to devices other
than the current one, they must be done on the [Key Moves] sheet.

For each button you want to assign a function to, go to the
Normal Function column and use the in-cell drop-down list to
select one. Remember, button names prefixed with "@" will be
setup as Key Moves, while the others will be part of the Device
Upgrade.

Selecting a function in the Shifted Function column will create a
Key Move on the shifted version of the corresponding button. All
Shifted Functions are ALWAYS setup as Key Moves.

The column titled Functions is a list of all the defined
functions from the [Functions] worksheet. As you assign functions
to buttons, the corresponding entries in this list will become
shaded to indicate that the function has been assigned. Entries
in light colored cells have not yet been used.

NOTE: In order to use the Key Move feature of the [Buttons]
sheet, you MUST be using IR v3.10 or later. Earlier versions of
IR DO NOT support the combined Device Upgrade/Key Move code and
will generate an error if you attempt to paste in combined code.

At the top of the [Buttons] sheet (cell G2) is an unlabeled check
box. This is the "DISABLE Combined Key Move Code" setting. When
checked (it mirrors the check box on the [Setup] sheet), any
buttons that are NOT part of the default "key map" (Normal
Functions assigned to any button preceded by "@" i.e. "@setup",
and ALL Shifted Functions) and would normally create Key Moves,
will not.

When all of your button assignments are complete, you can further
define your upgrade by creating additional Key Moves on the [Key
Moves] sheet.

*** Special note for remotes using a P8/740 processor:
------------------------------------------------------
There is a bug in the firmware for ALL P8/740 remotes that limits
the TOTAL length of a Device Upgrade to 50 bytes max. KM will
warn you if this limit is exceeded with the following message:

    "P8/740 remotes cannot handle upgrades greater than
     50 bytes.  Please remove ?? button assignments."

Unfortunately, the only known workaround for this limitation is
to create multiple upgrades of less than 50 bytes each. When you
see this message, you will need to delete at least as many button
assignments as indicated in the message ("??"). To do this,
select a cell in the Normal Function column and press the Delete
key.


Using the [Key Moves] worksheet:
================================
This feature allows you to define Key Moves based on the
functions defined in the current Device Upgrade. The [Key Moves]
sheet displays all the currently defined Functions by default.

Functions that appear in gray italic have been assigned to a
button on the [Buttons] sheet (either as part of the key map or
as a Key Move). Functions that appear in red have not yet been
assigned to any button.

A Function can be used multiple times by selecting it in the in-
cell drop-downs of the Function column. You can modify the
Function column by adding to and deleting from the default list.
This is how you would assign multiple Key Moves for the same
Function (i.e. you have a function that you want to make
available in all device modes).

NOTE: In order to use the code generated by the [Key Moves] sheet
in IR, you MUST be running IR v3.10 or later. Prior versions DO
NOT support importing Key Move code.

For each Function that you want to create a Key Move for, specify
the following:

Bound Device:
-------------
This is the Device button that the Key Move will be assigned to.
Select the appropriate Bound Device from the in-cell drop-down
list.

To assign the Key Move to the SAME device button as the Device
Upgrade, select "(upgrade)" from the list. When the code gets
pasted into IR, it will automatically assign the Key Move to the
same Device Button as the upgrade.

Bound Key:
----------
This is the button on the remote that the Key Move is assigned
to. Almost any button (including Shifted, Phantoms, etc) can be
assigned Key Moves. Select the desired key from the in-cell drop-
down.

A Bound Key name preceded by "$-" indicates that the button is
"shifted" (either because the button has been pre-defined as
being "shifted", or the Shift setting = "Yes").

NOTE: A hex button code may be directly entered in the Bound Key
cell by using the standard JP1 hex notation of "$XX". Simply
preceded the 2-digit hex code with a dollar sign ($). This is
useful for assigning additional phantoms, extender buttons, etc,
which are not currently defined by KM.

Shifted:
---------
Select "Yes" if you want the Key Move to be on a shifted button.
If a button is pre-defined as being "shifted", selecting "Yes"
will have no effect (there will be a "$-" preceding the button
name).

Max Key Move Bytes:
-------------------
Available Key Move space varies from remote to remote. Out of the
box, most JP1 remotes can hold approximately 40 to 45 Key Moves.
Extended remotes usually allow substantially more.

Since it is not easily possible for KM to know the actual amount
of Key Move space available for the selected remote when using
extenders, etc, nor can it tell what might already be included in
your current IR configuration, Key Move code length is defaulted
to the known length of the Key Move space designated by the
standard RDF for the selected remote. If you know that your
remote can accommodate more than the specified Key Move bytes,
simply enter a larger number in the "Max Key Moves Bytes" cell on
the Key Moves sheet.

NOTE: Just because you can specify a larger Max Key Move Bytes
and create Key Moves to that limit, it doesn't mean that IR (or
your remote) will accept them. If the generated Key Move Code
exceeds the amount defined by the RDF, IR will display an error
indicating that you have exceeded the Key Move limit. It will NOT
accept ANY of the imported Key Moves until enough have been
deleted to fit in the available space.

At the top of the [Key Moves] sheet (cell I1) is an unlabeled
check box. This is the "DISABLE Combined Key Move Code" setting.
When checked (it mirrors the check box on the [Setup] sheet), any
buttons that are NOT part of the default "key map" (Normal
Functions assigned to any button preceded by "@" i.e. "@setup",
and ALL Shifted Functions) and would normally create Key Moves,
will not.

The "DISABLE Combined Key Move Code" setting only affects the
[Key Moves] sheet IF the "Max Key Moves Bytes" limit is exceeded
by Key Moves created on the [Buttons] sheet.

Once all your Key Moves have been entered, the Key Move Code
block on the [Setup] sheet will contain the required code for
pasting into IR's [Key Moves] tab using the [Import] button.


Other KM Worksheets:
====================
There are a few additional KM worksheets:


The [Layout] sheet shows the buttons available in each of the
device modes for the selected remote. This is useful for seeing
at a glance what buttons are available for mapping.

The [Protocols] sheet is a listing of all the "named" protocols
that KM currently supports with a few details about each of them.
You can use this to see if the protocol you need is on KM's list.

The [Key Map] sheet is designed to be printed as a hard copy
reference for the current device upgrade. It lists all the
buttons that are mapped along with the Normal and Shifted
Functions assigned to each.

The [Code List] sheet is intended to help those users chasing the
elusive "missing" codes for their devices. It provides a
sequential list of EFC's or OBC's (000-255) so that you can
quickly see the "gaps" of missing codes. By default, it starts
out listing codes based on the current Button Codes setting (EFC
or OBC) on the [Setup] sheet. However, you can toggle this by
using the drop-down in cell A5 (it's highlighted in yellow) on
[Code List]. Print it out and you can start filling in all those
missing codes!

NOTE: All KM worksheets are formatted for quick and easy
printing. Each will print on either 1 or 2 pages if you wish to
have a hard copy reference of your settings.

<h2><a name="output"></a>The Output Panel</h2>
Device Upgrade Code block:
--------------------------
The large block centered on the [Setup] sheet doesn't allow any
data entry, and for good reason. That's where the calculated
Device Upgrade Code is displayed. Once you've entered all the
necessary information on the [Setup], [Functions], and [Buttons]
sheets ([Functions] and [Buttons] are described below), this will
be the code that you copy and paste into IR's [Devices] tab.

The Key Move feature of KM can combine Key Move code as part of
the Device Upgrade Code. This occurs when buttons that are not
part of the selected device's "key map" are assigned functions on
the [Buttons] sheet (see "Using the [Buttons] worksheet" below).

To copy the Device Upgrade Code to the Windows clipboard for
pasting into the IR [Devices] tab, press the [Copy] button or use
the keyboard shortcut of "Alt-D".

DISABLE Combined Key Move Code check box:
-----------------------------------------
You can temporarily exclude Key Moves (created on the [Buttons]
sheet) from the combined Device Upgrade/Key Move code by using
the "DISABLE Combined Key Move Code" check box directly below the
Device Upgrade Code block. This will allow only the Device
Upgrade Code to be displayed and selected for copying. This has
no effect on the Key Move Code block (for Key Moves created on
the [Key Moves] sheet).

There are also check boxes for this setting on the [Buttons]
(cell G2), and [Key Moves] (cell I1) sheets so that you can
quickly ENABLE or DISABLE and see how it affects the current
mapping.

Protocol Code block:
--------------------
Just below the Device Upgrade Code block is the Protocol Code
block. Again, no data entry is allowed here. As KM works its
magic, if it determines that the selected remote also requires a
protocol upgrade, it will display the necessary code here. In
that case, you will see a highlighted prompt that says

"*** The Protocol Code below is REQUIRED for this Upgrade ***"

This is a reminder to copy and paste this code into IR's
[Protocols] tab. If you create a Device Upgrade that requires
Protocol Code as well, and don't add it into IR, your upgrade
most likely won't work.

To copy the Protocol Code to the Windows clipboard for pasting
into the IR [Protocols] tab, press the [Copy] button or use the
keyboard shortcut of "Alt-P".

Key Move Code block:
--------------------
To the right of the Protocol Code block is the Key Move Code
block. This will contain the hex code for any key moves defined
on the [Key Moves] sheet (see the [Key Moves] worksheet section
below). This code gets pasted into the [Key Moves] tab in IR,
using the [Import] button.

To copy the Key Move Code to the Windows clipboard for pasting
into the IR [Key Moves] tab, press the [Copy] button or use the
keyboard shortcut of "Alt-K".
