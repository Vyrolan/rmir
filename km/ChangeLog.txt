Changes for v0.50

- Added Layout Panel, which shows which buttons are included in the key map
  for the selected device type.  This panel is driven by information in the
  RDF file.  The first is the Image= entry in the [General] section, which
  specifies the name of the file containing a picture of the remote.  It can be
  a GIF or JPG file.  Next is the [ButtonShapes] section, which contains a space
  separated list of button shape descriptors as follows:
  (button name)=(shape description) where
    (button name) is the name of a button defined in the [Buttons] section
    (shape desctiption) is one of:
      ellipse:(x),(y),(width),(height)
      rect:(x),(y),(width),(height)
      poly:(x),(y)[,(x),(y)]*
  Currently only the RDFs for the 15-1994, URC-6131, and URC-7800 have these
  these entries.
