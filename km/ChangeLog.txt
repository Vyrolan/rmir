  a GIF or JPG file.  Next is the [ButtonShapes] section, which contains a space
  separated list of button shape descriptors as follows:
  (button name)=(shape description) where
    (button name) is the name of a button defined in the [Buttons] section
    (shape desctiption) is one of:
      ellipse:(x),(y),(width),(height)

  these entries.
